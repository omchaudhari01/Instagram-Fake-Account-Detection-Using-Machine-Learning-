Abstract

With the growing influence of social media platforms like Instagram, the prevalence of fake accounts poses serious threats to user privacy, content authenticity, and platform integrity. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect fake Instagram accounts based on user profile features such as follower-following ratio, biography content, post activity, and engagement patterns. A comparative analysis of models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing real from fake accounts. The results demonstrate the potential of hybrid models in enhancing detection accuracy, contributing to safer and more reliable social media environments.
